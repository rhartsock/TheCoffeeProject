			  	<h3>Blends</h3>
			  	<p>
			  	Coffee blends are created when more than one type of bean, or beans from more that one grower are mixed
			  	together. The beans can be mixed either pre or post roast. Blends are very popular for a variety of reasons.
			  	From an economics standpoint, blends can be cheaper. If you mix high quality beans with a mid to low quality beans
			  	you can still end up with a good product for less cost.
			  	</p>
			  	<p>
			  	More importantly though, blends can combine the best features and characteristics of different beans to 
			  	deliver a product that is really better than the sum of its parts. The most common is an espresso blend.
			  	An espresso needs to have an oily, dark coffee to create a good crema, but you also want the brightness and 
			  	acidity of a light roast to cut through some of the richness of an espresso. As with anything, finding a balance
			  	is crucial, and blends allow for just that.
			  	</p>
			  	
			  	<h3>Single Origins</h3>
			  	<p>
			  	Unlike blends, in a single origin coffee all of the beans originate from the same place. This is great for 
			  	showing off the characteristics of various regions and plant varieties. For instance, the volcanic soils of
			  	Hawaii and Costa Rica both create a delightful acidity and brightness in the coffee grown in the region, 
			  	but the coffee from Hawaii is often sweeter and fruitier than the coffee from Costa Rica. 
			  	</p>
			  	
			  	<p>
			  	Single origins are a great way to experience a small part of another country and culture. The variety that you
			  	will find in single origin coffee is astonishing. Even coffee from the same region but grown on different 
			  	farms only a couple of miles apart can have staggering differences in flavor and aroma. If you want to be bold
			  	and adventurous, than single origin is the way to go.
			  	</p>
			  	
			  	<h3>Light Roast</h3>
			  	<p>
			  	Light roast coffees are, as their name suggests, lighter in color than dark roasts. This is because the 
			  	roasting process stops much sooner on a light roast than on a dark roast. Because a light roast is 
			  	placed under less heat, you will get much less of the roast flavor. This is often best for single origin
			  	coffee because the shorter roast time preserves more of the origin characteristics of the beans. Light roast
			  	often produces less oil and creates a lighter bodied cup where the acidity an brightness of the coffee can really shine.
			  	Also, light roasts have slightly more caffeine than dark roasts, so it might be the best choice for a morning wake up.   
			  	</p>

		         <br><br>
		         
			  	<h3>Dark Roast</h3>
			  	<p>
			  	In a dark roast, most of the origin characteristics have been replaced by the flavors and aromas produced
			  	by extended roasting. The added roast time often draws more oil out of the bean so you will see a shinier bean
			  	in the bag and have a more full bodied, rich coffee in the cup. Dark roast is the standard for Italian and
			  	French blends and makes up the bulk of espresso blends. While a dark roast may not be the way to preserve the 
			  	delicate characteristics of a single origin bean, increased oil in a dark roast helps create a 
			  	thicker, creamy crema on top of an espresso.

		         <h3>Green</h3>
			  	<p>
			  	Green coffee is simply coffee that has been washed and dried but not roasted. This is the starting product
			  	when the coffee arrives at the roaster. From here it can be mixed with other coffee to form a blend or roasted 
			  	alone as a single origin.

		        Freshly ground coffee is a must. More than any other step in the brewing process, 
		        grinding your coffee fresh at each use will make the most noticeable impact on the final product.
		        The coffee experience is two parts, aromatics and taste and oxygen is the enemy of both. 
		        As the coffee begins to oxidize the aroma disappears and the flavor becomes stale.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        The best way to combat the oxidation process is to reduce the amount of surface area exposed to oxygen.
		        Pre-ground coffee is almost all surface area and therefore oxidizes very quickly. Whole bean coffee on the other hand has
		        much less surface area and is able to stay fresh for much longer, especially when stored in an airtight container.
		        </p>
		        
		      	<h3>Grinder</h3>
		        <h4>Conical Burr Grinder</h4>
		        <p>
		        The conical burr grinder is the best way to grind coffee. It works by smashing the beans in between an angled spindle
		        and a ring. Usually both the spindle and ring are made with ridges to keep the coffee in place. By adjusting the space
		        between the spindle and ring you can adjust the coarseness of the coffee. A conical burr grinder is the only grinder
		        capable of grinding coarse enough for a French Press all the way to ultra fine espresso or Turkish coffee.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        Because a conical burr grinder relies on pressure instead of speed to break the beans it creates much less friction
		        and therefore much less heat than other grinders. This results is a fresher tasting cup of coffee. Additionally
		        a conical burr grinder is the most accurate method for grinding coffee. Because every bean goes through the same 
		        burr assembly all of the grounds are the same size. Consistent size grounds leads to an even extraction. If some of the 
		        coffee is very coarse and some very thin you will have both over extraction and bitterness as well as under extraction and 
		        a weak cup of coffee.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        Burr grinders can be found in both <a href="http://amzn.to/13eGqpS">electric</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1yXHxpY">elbow-grease</a> powered varieties.

		        <h4>Blade Grinder</h4>
		        <p>
		        The blade grinder works by spinning incredibly fast and chopping the coffe beans into smaller pieces.
		        Because of the speed required to chop the hard coffee beans, a tremendous amount of friction is generated around the blade.
		        This causes the grounds to heat up and speed the oxidation process. While there might be a very small difference in flavor and
		        overall quality due to the very short increased period of oxidation, the real downside to a blade grinder is the lack of consistency
		        and flexibility. Because the grounds just fly about in the grinding chamber, there is no way to ensure that each bean is ground evenly.
		        This can lead to uneven extraction and an underwhelming and bitter cup of coffee. Additionally, a blade grinder is not capable
		        of grinding coffee finely enough to be used in espresso or Turkish coffee.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        Unlike burr grinders which come in both electric and elbow grease powered, blade grinders can only be found as  
		        <a href="http://amzn.to/1vWZ6pi">electric models</a>.

		        <h3>Coarseness</h3>
		        <p>
		        The coarseness that you grind your beans to will play a crucial role in making sure that
		        your coffee is extracted properly. If the grind is too fine, you will have over extracted coffee.
		        If the grind is too coarse, the coffee will be weak and under extracted. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        Getting the correct coarseness is easiest on an electric burr grinder. Most of these machines have
		        settings for each coarseness or brew method. With a hand burr grinder, you have to adjust the machine
		        manually and rely on your judgement for the proper coarseness. This can take some practice. If you choose
		        to use a manual burr grinder, it can be beneficial to use the professional grinder at your local
		        supermarket or coffee shop to get a small sample of coffee correctly ground to each coarseness so that you can
		        compare to what you are grinding at home. An electric blade grinder is the most difficult to create an even and 
		        correct grind. Because the blade spins rapidly and chops whatever happens to be in front of it, it is nearly
		        impossible to ensure that all of the coffee is ground evenly.

		        <p>
		        Water makes up the bulk of your cup of coffee, so it is crucial to start with clean filtered water. 
		        Tap water can contain a wide variety of metals and minerals and it is important to remove as many as possible
		        before using it to make coffee. A great cup of coffee is a complex balance of acidity, body, subtle flavor and aroma,
		        and hard, metallic or mineral heavy water can have a very noticeable negative effect on coffee by throwing off that delicate balance.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        A refrigerator with a built in water filter that is changed regularly works great, but if that is not an option, a

			  <p>The AeroPress is the newest of the hand brew methods. Developed by 
			     Alan Adler in 2005 it has taken the specialty brewing scene by storm. Praised
			     for its fast brew time and the smooth final product, the AeroPress is
			     a valuable addition for any coffee enthusiast, and at a price of only
			     <a href="http://amzn.to/1pD7bhs">$25</a> , it is well within reach of 
			     most consumers. <br><br></p>

		        <p>Patented by Attilio Calimani in 1929, the French Press has been around for quite a while.
			     By using the full immersion method where the grounds are submerged in the water for a full four minutes,
			     you are able to extract very deep and complex flavors from the French Press. 
			     The French Press uses a metal screen filter, much coarser than paper filters found in other devices. 
			     This means that less is lost to the filter with the French Press, most notably the coffee oils create an emulsion with
			     the water and add a fuller body and depth of flavor to the final product. There is a tradeoff however, the coarser filter
			     produces a less clean cup of coffee than a paper filter and it is common to find coffee sediment in the bottom of the cup.
			     The French Press comes in a <a href="http://amzn.to/1zciBKa">range of brands, sizes and prices.</a>

		        <p>The pour over is the most economical of all of the hand brew methods starting at only 
		        <a href="http://amzn.to/1z44UOK">$5.</a> Do not let the low cost fool you though, the pour over 
		        produces one of brightest, cleanest and most lively cups of coffee you will find. Because the 
		        pour over is not a full immersion brew like the AeroPress and the French Press, the water spends less
		        time in contact with the beans. This makes it much harder to end up with coffee that is over extracted and
		        bitter. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        While we are fairly safe from over extraction with the pour over, under extraction can become a problem.
		        The best way to ensure a properly extracted cup of coffee with the pour over is start with the right 
		        size grounds, let the coffee bloom and spread the pours over the course of three minutes.
